# Project Report: Football Player Re-identification

## 1. Approach and Methodology

The goal of this project was to build a system that can track and re-identify football players in a video. The system is designed as a pipeline of several components:

*   **Player Detection**: The first step is to detect all players in each frame of the video. This was accomplished using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model, which is a state-of-the-art object detection model. The model was chosen for its balance of accuracy and performance.

*   **Player Tracking**: Once players are detected, they need to be tracked from one frame to the next. A multi-object tracking algorithm was implemented using a combination of a Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm. The Kalman filter predicts the future position of each player, and the Hungarian algorithm associates the current detections with the predicted positions.

*   **Re-identification**: If a player is lost and then reappears, the system needs to be able to re-identify them. This is the most challenging part of the project. A deep learning-based approach was used, where a feature vector is extracted for each detected player. When a new player is detected, its feature vector is compared to the feature vectors of previously seen players to find a match.

## 2. Techniques and Outcomes

Several techniques were considered and experimented with during the development of the project:

*   **Object Detection**: Other object detection models like Faster R-CNN and SSD were considered. However, YOLOv5 was chosen due to its superior speed, which is crucial for real-time video processing.

*   **Tracking**: Simpler tracking methods like correlation-based trackers were initially tried. These were found to be not robust enough for the complex occlusions and fast movements found in a football game. The Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm combination provided much better results.

*   **Re-identification**: The re-identification component is the most experimental part of the system. The current implementation uses a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features. The results are promising but could be improved with a more sophisticated model and a larger training dataset.

## 3. Challenges Encountered

*   **Occlusion**: Players frequently get occluded by other players, the ball, or other objects on the field. This makes it difficult to track players consistently.

*   **Similar Appearance**: Players on the same team wear similar uniforms, which makes it challenging to distinguish between them.

*   **Real-time Performance**: Processing a video in real-time is computationally expensive. A lot of effort was put into optimizing the code and choosing efficient algorithms.

## 4. Future Work

If more time and resources were available, the following improvements could be made:

*   **Improved Re-identification Model**: The re-identification model could be improved by using a more advanced architecture and training it on a larger dataset of football players.

*   **Team and Player Identification**: The system could be extended to identify the team of each player and even recognize individual players by their jersey numbers.

*   **Ball Tracking**: The system could also be extended to track the ball, which would provide more context for analyzing the game.
